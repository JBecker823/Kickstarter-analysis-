Kickstarting with Excel
Overview of Project- The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise find out how other plays resulted in their fund-raising goals. We looked at play fund raising from all over the world to determine what plays reached pledge goals and what plays did not. 

Analysis and Challenges: This analysis was challenging because it was a large amount of data. Filtering and color coding was easy and made it easier to view the data set. It was interesting to see the different levels of plays and what categories were successful verse the ones that were not. The most challenging part of the module for me was the Git hub portions, submitting seemed to give me an issue. 

Conclusions on Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? When looking at the Outcomes based on Launch Date, you can see that there was a correlation between the failed and successful outcomes. The successful outcomes increased in the first quarter where the failed outcomes decreased. In the 2nd quarter the successful outcomes increased in the beginning of the quarter, but then dropped drastically closer to the 3rd quarter as the failed outcomes increased from April to June of the 2nd quarter. 
	In the 3rd quarter both failed and successful outcomes decreased then increased heading into the 4th quarter. By the end of the 4th quarter the successful outcomes made a dive down while the failed outcomes remained relatively the same. We can conclude that the successful outcomes decrease after the failed outcomes increased. While the successful outcomes were taking a decline, the canceled outcomes were increasing. 

Outcomes Based on Goals

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? When looking at the outcomes based on goals, the highest outcomes had the biggest fail rate. While the lowest outcomes had the highest success rate over failed rate. The goals of over $45,000 had a very low success rate, while the goals from 0 to $24,999 had an average of over 50% success rate. This shows that the higher the goal, the lower the success rate. For most of the failed outcomes, the goal was less than halfway met. 

Limitations of this Dataset

- What are some limitations of this dataset? Some of the limitations of this dataset are the types of data and the amount of data. The data does not tell us what each outcome was doing to produce the pledged amount. Such as if some specific type of fund raising was to work better than another that is not determined. By knowing the most successful fund raising, the failed outcomes could try differently for future performances. 

Other Tables or Graphs

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? One type of table that could be created that might be useful to help with future funding would be a chart with success rates, failed rates, along with canceled rates, with the period that was open for each funding. Maybe if the funding period had been extended more failed or canceled shows would have been able to meet pledge goals. I did find the pivot table to be the most helpful at viewing the data.
